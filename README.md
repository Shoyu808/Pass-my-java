## *About this repository*

Hello everyone! Welcome to the *pass-my-java* repository. Today what I'm about to show you is all about Javascript. So my goal here with [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) is to generate a password for you. A password generator that could generate random characters for you of your choice. The choices you get to pick are lower case letters, capital letters, numbers, and special characters. Here's the link to the [Password Generator](https://shoyu808.github.io/Pass-my-java/).
