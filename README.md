## *About this repository*

Hello everyone! Welcome to the *pass-my-java* repository. Today what I'm about to show you is all about Javascript. So my goal here with [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) is to generate a password for you. A password generator that could generate random characters for you of your choice. The choices you get to pick are lower case letters, capital letters, numbers, and special characters. Here's the link to the [Password Generator](https://shoyu808.github.io/Pass-my-java/).

## *How can I pass my java to you?*

I'll show you how I can pass on my java to you. Make sure to have a terminal emulator that is compatible with the system you're using whether it be a [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) or [Microsoft PC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows). If you don't have a terminal you could use the [Gitbash terminal](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  which is the terminal that i'm currently using. You'll also want to setup your ssh keys to protect your local files and to recieve repository on Github. [Guide on setting up ssh keys for Github.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) Next you'll need a text langauge to view the code. The text langauge that i'm currently using is Vscode, you could download it in this link here [Vscode download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). After you've got everything installed go to the code button on my Repository and copy the ssh key. Then clone the Repository on your terminal with git clone including my ssh key.

## *Usage on Javascript*

This is the image of my javascript file.

As you can see in the image I have describe how my javascript works with comments on it. Like how that function works on line 12. So what's happening in line 12 is a function that generates the password. What I needed inside of the function to work are my variables with the user choices of the password and also for the characters. Then I created 4 *confirms* to ask the user how they want their password. I created a *prompt* to ask the user how many characters they would want in their password. You could take a look at my script file if you want to learn how to generate a password.
